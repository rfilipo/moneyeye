- Create Money.h and Money.cpp under src
 (From bootstrap)
  (added Sun Jan 21 00:57:27 2018, completed on Sun Jan 21 01:17:49 2018, priority high)

- Test for Class existence and instantiation
 (From bootstrap)
  (added Sun Jan 21 00:57:58 2018, completed on Sun Jan 21 01:18:21 2018, priority high)

- Implement the class Money
 (With simple constructor)
  (added Sun Jan 21 00:58:43 2018, completed on Sun Jan 21 02:18:59 2018, priority high)

- Test: Money must be instantiated with the
  properties: currency, country, value
  (added Sun Jan 21 00:59:10 2018, completed on Sun Jan 21 02:21:44 2018, priority high)

- Implement Money constructor
 (Still to be done an auxiliary function to
 construct the face string with signs and cents
 or variants. This function should proccess the
 JSON also.)
  (added Sun Jan 21 01:00:44 2018, completed on Sun Jan 21 21:20:52 2018, priority high)

- Test: Class must get and set the properties
  value, currency and country
 (not need setters. All is done by constructor or
 exchange method)
  (added Sun Jan 21 01:03:00 2018, completed on Sun Jan 21 03:56:06 2018, priority high)

- Implement Money getters and setters
 (only getters)
  (added Sun Jan 21 01:03:22 2018, completed on Sun Jan 21 03:56:54 2018, priority high)

- Tests: The method exchange must take the new
  value searching data from a local JSON file
 (Had pronlems with JSON file location)
  (added Sun Jan 21 01:04:00 2018, completed on Sun Jan 21 21:22:18 2018, priority high)

- Implement auxiliar method to read the JSON file
  returning only the data needed for this
  exchange
 (Some memory problem with cJSON lib fixed)
  (added Sun Jan 21 01:04:17 2018, completed on Mon Jan 22 13:16:56 2018, priority high)

- exchange method creating and returning a new
  Money object exchanged
 (Dont need a auc func for face)
  (added Sun Jan 21 01:04:33 2018, completed on Mon Jan 22 13:17:43 2018, priority high)

- Implement auxiliary function to generate the
  face string
 (Dont need func for face generation ...)
  (added Sun Jan 21 04:01:59 2018, completed on Mon Jan 22 13:17:59 2018, priority high)

- Create a test module ( 001-basicTest.cpp )
 (From bootstrap)
  (added Sun Jan 21 00:54:21 2018, completed on Sun Jan 21 01:17:16 2018, priority medium)
