# What is moneyeye?

Simple study for money and finance functions on TDD Method.
  Tutorial for TDD development under autotools/cpp/boost

The final system implement tools for creation and maintainance of asset records 
- debit or credit transactions
- several accounts
- several currencies
- authentication
- reporting
- data encryption
- payment transactions cicles
- documents/media files transactions cicles 
- financial Functions

## Topics

- project methodologies and management (scrum, autotools, github)
- c++ revisions and libraries study (c++ core, boost, boost::test, cJSON)
- structural and model infra-structure
- basic tests
- proof of concept about the work "Financial Numerical Recipes in C++" by Bernt Arne Ã˜degaard

### Activities:
- Scrum guide
- Basic autotools project
- Create unit tests from requirements
- C++ Concepts ( Classes, Chars and Strings) 

__Version 0.2.?__ - The object of the class Money must be small as possible and without hard ties with large memory chunks, so all configurations and external resources as configurations, json files, lists, etc, must be done by a Prototype Factory Singleton class: MoneyFactory.

### Activities:
- D. Patterns: Factory, Singleton, Prototype, Pool 
- Refactoring 
- Overload operators
- Memory management
